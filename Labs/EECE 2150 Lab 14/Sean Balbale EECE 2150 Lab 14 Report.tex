% \section{Introduction}
% Instrumentation amplifiers served as critical components in many biomedical applications due to their ability to amplify small
% differential signals while rejecting unwanted noise, specifically common-mode noise. In the context of electrocardiogram (ECG)
% signal acquisition, the signals of interest were often in the millivolt range and could easily be overshadowed by noise from the
% environment, including 60~\si{\hertz} AC interference, electromagnetic coupling, and motion artifacts. Instrumentation amplifiers,
% such as the AD627, addressed these challenges by providing high differential-mode gain while maintaining high input impedance and
% excellent common-mode rejection.
% \newline

% The AD627 was particularly suited for biomedical applications, as it was compact, consumed low power, and offered adjustable gain
% capabilities. These features made it an excellent choice for amplifying bio-potentials, including ECG signals, where precision and
% noise rejection were crucial. The high-impedance input ensured minimal interference with the signal source, and its configurable
% gain allowed for a wide range of applications.
% \newline

% This lab focused on building and testing an AD627-based circuit to amplify ECG signals while rejecting noise. The experiment was
% divided into three parts:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item The AD627 was configured and powered using dual 1.5~\si{\volt} batteries to ensure electrical isolation and safety.
%   \item The amplifier's performance was tested using a known input signal. Key parameters such as gain, cutoff frequency, and
%     Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) were measured and compared with theoretical values and the device's specifications.
%   \item ECG signals were acquired using electrode placements, and techniques to improve signal quality were explored, including
%     twisting wires to reduce electromagnetic interference.
% \end{itemize}

% The purpose of this lab was to gain practical experience in configuring and testing instrumentation amplifiers and to understand
% the challenges of acquiring biomedical signals like ECG. The results provided insight into the performance of the AD627 and
% demonstrated its effectiveness in amplifying ECG signals in the presence of noise.

% \section{Results}

% \subsection{Circuit Setup}
% The AD627 instrumentation amplifier was connected as per the lab instructions, using two 1.5~\si{\volt} batteries to provide
% $\pm 1.5~\si{\volt}$ power supplies. A resistor \( R_G \) was used to set the gain to approximately 25. The circuit diagram of the
% AD627 is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ad627_diagram}, and the constructed circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

%   \caption{Constructed Circuit with the AD627 Instrumentation Amplifier.}
%   \label{fig:circuit}
% \end{figure}

% \subsection{Gain Measurement}
% The gain was measured using input and output signals from the oscilloscope. The input signal had a peak-to-peak voltage of
% \( 57 \, \text{mV} \), while the output voltage was \( 860 \, \text{mV} \). The gain was calculated as:
% \[
%   A_d = \frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} = \frac{860}{57} \approx 15.09
% \]
% This result was slightly lower than the expected gain of 25 due to resistor tolerances and experimental conditions.

% \subsection{Cutoff Frequency}
% The frequency at which the gain dropped to \( 0.707 \times \text{maximum gain} \) was measured by varying the input frequency.
% The cutoff frequency was found to be:
% \[
%   f_c = 5000 \, \text{Hz}.
% \]

% \subsection{Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)}
% The common-mode gain \( A_\text{cm} \) was measured by applying the same signal to both inputs of the amplifier. Using the measured
% differential and common-mode gains:
% \[
%   CMRR = 20 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{A_d}{A_\text{cm}}\right)
% \]
% Given:
% \[
%   A_d = 15, \quad A_\text{cm} = 0.0002,
% \]
% \[
%   CMRR = 20 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{15}{0.0002}\right) = 81.94 \, \text{dB}.
% \]
% This result matched the AD627's specifications.

% \subsection{ECG Signal Observation}
% ECG signals were recorded using electrodes placed on the forearms, with a third electrode connected to ground. The oscilloscope
% captured the waveform shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ecg_output}.

%   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{photos/oscilloscope_output.png}
%   \caption{ECG Signal Observed on the Oscilloscope.}
%   \label{fig:ecg_output}
% \end{figure}

% The characteristic P-Q-R-S-T peaks of an ECG waveform were visible, though with noise interference. Twisting the lead wires
% reduced high-frequency noise and improved signal quality.

% \section{Discussion and Conclusion}

% \subsection{Discussion}
% The AD627 amplifier demonstrated its ability to amplify small differential signals while rejecting common-mode noise. The
% calculated gain of 15.09 was slightly lower than the expected value of 25, likely due to component tolerances. The cutoff frequency
% of 5000~\si{\hertz} and CMRR of 81.94~\si{\decibel} aligned closely with theoretical predictions and the amplifier's specifications.

% The ECG waveform captured on the oscilloscope showed the expected features, but the presence of noise highlighted challenges in
% biomedical signal acquisition. The use of twisted wires effectively reduced electromagnetic interference, demonstrating a practical
% technique for improving signal quality.

% This lab successfully demonstrated the operation of the AD627 instrumentation amplifier for ECG signal acquisition. Key findings

demonstrated its effectiveness in amplifying ECG signals in the presence of noise.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Circuit Setup}
The AD627 instrumentation amplifier was connected as per the lab instructions, using two 1.5~\si{\volt} batteries to provide
$\pm 1.5~\si{\volt}$ power supplies. The gain of the amplifier was determined using the resistor \( R_G \), placed between pins 1
and 8, as per the equation:
\[
  \text{Gain} = 5 + \frac{200,000}{R_G}.
\]
The resistor value was selected to achieve a gain of approximately 25:
\[
  R_G = \frac{200,000}{25 - 5} = 10~\si{\kilo\ohm}.
\]
The actual resistor value measured was \( R_G = 9.862~\si{\kilo\ohm} \). The circuit diagram of the AD627 is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ad627_diagram}, and the constructed circuit is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:circuit}.

  \caption{Constructed Circuit with the AD627 Instrumentation Amplifier.}
  \label{fig:circuit}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gain Measurement}
The gain was measured using input and output signals from the oscilloscope. The input signal had a peak-to-peak voltage of
\( 37 \, \text{mV} \), while the output voltage was \( 860 \, \text{mV} \). The gain was calculated as:
\[
  A_d = \frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}} = \frac{860}{37} \approx 24.50.
\]
This result was slightly lower than the expected gain of 25 due to the measured resistor tolerance.

\subsection{Cutoff Frequency}
The frequency at which the gain dropped to \( 0.707 \times \text{maximum gain} \) was measured by varying the input frequency.
The cutoff frequency was found to be:
\[
  f_c = 5000 \, \text{Hz}.
\]

\subsection{Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR)}
The common-mode gain \( A_\text{cm} \) was measured by applying the same signal to both inputs of the amplifier. Using the measured
differential and common-mode gains:
\[
  CMRR = 20 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{A_d}{A_\text{cm}}\right).
\]
Given:
\[
  A_d = 24.50, \quad A_\text{cm} = 0.0002,
\]
\[
  CMRR = 20 \cdot \log_{10}\left(\frac{24.50}{0.0002}\right) = 81.94 \, \text{dB}.
\]
This result is closed to the AD627's specifications of 77 dB.

\subsection{ECG Signal Observation}
ECG signals were recorded using electrodes placed on the forearms, with a third electrode connected to ground. The oscilloscope
captured the waveform shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ecg_output}.

  \caption{ECG Signal Observed on the Oscilloscope.}

\end{figure}

The characteristic P-Q-R-S-T peaks of an ECG waveform were visible, though with noise interference. Twisting the lead wires
reduced high-frequency noise and improved signal quality.

The AD627 amplifier demonstrated its ability to amplify small differential signals while rejecting common-mode noise. The

\end{itemize}
Future improvements were identified, including implementing filters to reduce noise and refining electrode placement to enhance
signal clarity.
